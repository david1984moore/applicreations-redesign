# Project Status

**Current Task:** How it works cinema — step-3 table copy, then screens go-live line

**⚠️ CRITICAL: NO DELAWARE REFERENCES** - Site must be generic/national, not location-specific. All copy must be truthful.

**⚠️ LOCKED Aug 18 2026 (final) — How it works live-preview cord.** User: absolutely perfect. Do not edit `wirePath` / `PreviewWire` / cord stroke / port-jack attachments in `HiwDeviceSketch.tsx`.

**⚠️ LOCKED Aug 25 2026 (final) — Get Started / Start Re-design CTA.** User: likes exactly how they act. Do not retune `SpectrumFlipCta` layout, origin, hover check, nudge, or bloom.
